Quick Browse and Notes
==========
What does it do?
----------------
This is a simple script that allows you to quickly browse through a directory and open files in your default text editor. It also allows you to browse the web and take notes with a single keybind.
It is super easy to set up - run the python file on startup with the necessary packages and you are good to go! There are currently no arguments for the script, and it is opened with the default 
keybinds of `Ctrl+U` for opening.
